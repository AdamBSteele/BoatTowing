<p>

These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Drift, Inc. (“Drift,” “we,” “us” or “our”) governing your use of the Drift application, website, and technology platform (collectively, the “Drift Platform”). Your use of the Drift Platform acknowledges your acceptance of and agreement to these terms of service.

By entering into to this Agreement, and/or by using or accessing the Drift platform you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement (including the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions) and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE Drift PLATFORM. 
</p>
<h2>
The Drift Platform
</h2>
<p>
The Drift Platform provides a marketplace where persons who seek transportation to certain destinations (“Towees”) can be matched with persons navigating to or through those destinations (“Towers”). Towers and Towees are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and each User shall create a User account that enables access to the Drift Platform. Each person may only create one User account, and Drift reserves the right to shut down any additional accounts. As a User, you authorize Drift to match you with a Tower or Towee based only on positional factors such as your location, the estimated time to pickup, your destination, user preferences, and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match and rematch based on the same considerations. For purposes of this Agreement, the Towing services provided by Towers to Towees that are matched through the Platform shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”. Any decision by a User to offer or accept Services is a decision made in such User’s sole discretion. Each Towing Service provided by a Tower to a Towee shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons that does not include Drift as a party.  

By using our service you acknowledge that Drift is not an employer nor a vessel owner or operator and that Drift has performed no comprehensive or detailed background checking or screening of any of its users and therefore you agree to release Drift and hold Drift harmless of and from any liability for injury, loss of life or property damage arising out of any claim that Drift was negligent or careless.
</p>
<h4>
Modification to the Agreement
</h4>
<p>
In the event Drift modifies the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement on the very next use of the system. Drift reserves the right to modify any information referenced in the hyperlinks from this Agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the Drift Platform or Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. 
</p>
<h4>
Eligibility
</h4>
<p>
The Drift Platform may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. You may not allow other persons to use your User account, and you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your account.
</p>
<h4>
Charges
</h4>
<p>
As a Towee, you understand that request or use of the Services may result in charges to you (“Charges”). Charges include Tows and other applicable fees, tolls, surcharges, and taxes as set forth on your market’s Drift Cities page (https://www.driftboat.io/tampa-bay). Drift has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms to your market’s Drift Cities page or quoting you a price for a specific Tow at the time you make a request. 

You are solely responsible for reviewing the applicable Drift Cities page or price quote within the Drift app and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
</p>
<h4>
Tows. 
</h4>
<p>
There are two types of Tows, variable and quoted.

Variable Tows. Variable Tows consist of a base charge and incremental charges based on the duration and distance of your tow. For particularly short tows, minimum rates may apply. Please note that we use GPS data from your Tower's phone to calculate the distance traveled on your tow. We cannot guarantee the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal we will calculate time and distance using available data from your tow.
Quoted Rates. In some cases Drift may quote you a rate at the time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the tow request is confirmed. If during your tow you change your destination, make multiple stops, or attempt to abuse the Drift Platform, we may at our discretion cancel the rate quote and charge you a variable rate  based on the time and distance of your tow. Drift does not guarantee that the quoted rate  will be equal to a variable rate for the same tow.
</p>
<h4>
Fees and Other Charges.​
</h4>
<p>
Cancellation Fee. After requesting a tow you may cancel it through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee may apply. You may also be charged if you fail to show up after requesting a tow. Please check out our Help Center to learn more about Drift’s cancellation policy, including applicable fees.
Damage Fee. Any claims for damage between a Tower and Towee shall be resolved between them and shall not involve Drift except that a claim for a material damage by Towee to Tower shall result in a “Damage Fee” assessed by Drift in an amount no greater than $250.00.  
Tips. Following a tow, you may elect to tip your Tower in cash or through the Drift application. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable Tower.
</p>
<h4>
General.
</h4>
<p>
Facilitation of Charges. All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processing service (e.g., Stripe, Inc., or Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.). Drift may replace its third-party payment processing services without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the Drift Platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments or payments outside the Drift Platform are strictly prohibited. Your payment of Charges to Drift satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the Drift Platform and Services.
No Refunds. All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Drift Platform, any disruption to the Drift Platform or Services, or any other reason whatsoever.
Credit Card Authorization. Upon addition of a new payment method or each tow request, Drift may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the tow cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. 
Credit Card Chargebacks. You agree that once you have authorized a charge with us, that you will waive any and all rights to assert a chargeback with your credit card company or otherwise seek a refund from your credit card provider. 
​
</p>
<h4>
Payments
</h4>
<p>
If you are a Tower, you will receive payment for your provision of Services pursuant to the terms of the Tower Addendum, which shall form part of this Agreement between you and Drift. The Tower Addendum is available in the Driver dashboard when you log into your account.
</p>
<h4>
Drift Communications
</h4>
<p>
By entering into this Agreement or using the Platform, you agree to receive communications from us, including via e-mail, text message, calls, and push notifications. You agree that texts, calls or prerecorded messages may be generated by automatic telephone dialing systems. Communications from Drift, its affiliated companies and/or Towers, may include but are not limited to: operational communications concerning your User account or use of the Drift Platform or Services, updates concerning new and existing features on the Drift Platform, communications concerning promotions run by us or our third-party partners, and news concerning Drift and industry developments. Standard text messaging charges applied by your cell phone carrier will apply to text messages we send. These communications are governed by our privacy policy. 
</p>
<h4>
Promotions and Referral Programs
</h4>
<p>
Drift, at its sole discretion, may make available promotions with different features to any Users or prospective Users. These promotions, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your Agreement or relationship with Drift. Drift reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or benefits obtained through a promotion in the event that Drift determines or believes that the redemption of the promotion or receipt of the credit or benefit was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable promotion terms or this Agreement.
As part of your User account, Drift may provide you with or allow you to create a “Drift Code,” a unique alphanumeric code for you to distribute to your friends and family (each a “Referred User”) to become new Drift Towees (“Referred Towees”) or Towers (“Referred Towers”) in your country. Drift Codes may only be distributed for promotional purposes and must be given away free of charge. You may not sell, trade, or barter your Drift Code. You are prohibited from advertising Drift Codes in any way, including through any of the following: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Craigslist. Drift reserves the right to deactivate or invalidate any Drift Code at any time in Drift’s discretion.
From time to time, Drift may offer you with incentives to refer your friends and family to become new Users of the Drift Platform in your country (the “Referral Program”). These incentives may come in the form of Drift Credits, and Drift may set or change the incentive types, amounts, terms, restrictions, and qualification requirements for any incentives in its sole discretion. Your distribution of Drift Codes and participation in the Referral Program is subject to this Agreement and the additional Referral Program rules.

<h4>
Disclaimers
</h4>
<p>
The following disclaimers are made on behalf of Drift, our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and shareholders.
Drift does not provide transportation services, and Drift is not a transportation carrier. Drift is not a common carrier or public carrier. It is up to the Tower to decide whether or not to offer a tow to a Towee contacted through the Drift Platform, and it is up to the Towee to decide whether or not to accept a tow from any Tower contacted through the Drift Platform. We cannot ensure that a Tower or Towee will complete an arranged transportation service. We have no control over the quality or safety of the transportation that occurs as a result of the Services.

The Drift Platform is provided without any representations, warranties or conditions, express, implied or statutory. We do not guarantee and do not promise any specific results from use of the Drift Platform and/or the Services, including the ability to provide or receive Services at any given location or time. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we specifically disclaim any implied warranties. 

We do not warrant that your use of the Drift Platform or Services will be accurate, complete, reliable, current, secure, uninterrupted, always available, or error- free, or will meet your requirements, that any defects in the Drift Platform will be corrected, or that the Drift Platform is free of viruses or other harmful components. We disclaim liability for, and no warranty is made with respect to, connectivity and availability of the Drift Platform or Services.

We cannot guarantee that each Tower or Towee is who he or she claims to be. Please use common sense when using the Drift Platform and Services, including looking at the photos of the Tower or Towee you have matched with to make sure it is the same individual you see in person. Please note that there are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense, and we do not accept responsibility or liability for any content, communication or other use or access of the Drift Platform by persons under the age of 18 in violation of this Agreement. We encourage you to communicate directly with each potential Tower or Towee prior to engaging in an arranged transportation service.

Drift is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any User of the Drift Platform or Services. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users. We do not procure insurance for, nor are we responsible for, personal belongings left in the boat by Towers or Towees. By using the Drift Platform and participating in the Services, you agree to accept such risks and agree that Drift is not responsible for the acts or omissions of Users on the Drift Platform or participating in the Services.

You are responsible for the use of your User account and Drift expressly disclaims any liability arising from the unauthorized use of your User account. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your User account or you suspect any other breach of security, you agree to notify us immediately.

It is possible for others to obtain information about you that you provide, publish or post to or through the Drift Platform (including any profile information you provide), send to other Users, or share during the Services, and to use such information to harass or harm you. We are not responsible for the use of any personal information that you disclose to other Users on the Drift Platform or through the Services. Please carefully select the type of information that you post on the Drift Platform or through the Services or release to others. We disclaim all liability, regardless of the form of action, for the acts or omissions of other Users (including unauthorized users, or “hackers”).

Location data provided by the Drift Platform is for basic location purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Drift, nor any of its content providers, guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data tracked or displayed by the Drift Platform. Any of your Information, including geolocational or geopositional data, you upload, provide, or post on the Drift Platform may be accessible to Drift and certain Users of the Drift Platform.

Drift advises you to use the Drift Platform with a data plan with unlimited or very high data usage limits, and Drift shall not responsible or liable for any fees, costs, or overage charges associated with any data plan you use to access the Drift Platform.
</p>
<h4>
Indemnity
​</h4>
<p>
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Drift including our affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, successors and assigns, and each of our respective officers, directors, employees, agents, Towers, Towees or shareholders harmless from any claims, actions, suits, losses, costs, injuries, death, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of any towing service you provide or that is provided to you or your use of the Drift Platform and participation in the Services, including: (1) your breach of this Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference; (2) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party, including, Towers, Towees, other motorists, and pedestrians, as a result of your own interaction with such third party; (3) any allegation that any materials that you submit to us or transmit through the Drift Platform or to us infringe or otherwise violate the copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or other rights of any third party; (4) your ownership, use or operation of a vessel including your provision of Services as an operator or Tower; and/or (5) any other activities in connection with the Services. This indemnity shall be applicable without regard to the negligence of any party, including any indemnified person.
</p>
<h4>
Limitation of Liability
</h4>
<p>
IN NO EVENT WILL DRIFT, INCLUDING OUR AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PARENTS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SHAREHOLDERS (COLLECTIVELY “Drift” FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION), BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR DELETION, CORRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROGRAMS, FAILURE TO STORE ANY INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT MAINTAINED OR TRANSMITTED BY THE Drift PLATFORM, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE Drift PLATFORM, THE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER ARISING INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, EVEN IF WE OR OUR AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES KNOW OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE Drift PLATFORM MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR OTHER SERVICES WITH THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT DRIFT HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO ANY TRANSPORTATION, GOODS OR OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

In addition, Drift may terminate this Agreement or deactivate your User account in its sole discretion immediately in the event: (1) you no longer qualify to provide Services or to operate the approved vessel under applicable law, rule, permit, ordinance or regulation; (2) you fall below Drift’s star rating or cancellation threshold; (3) Drift has the good faith belief that such action is necessary to protect the safety of the Drift community or third parties, provided that in the event of a deactivation pursuant to (1)-(3) above, you will be given notice of the potential or actual deactivation and an opportunity to attempt to cure the issue to Drift’s sole satisfaction prior to Drift permanently terminating the Agreement. For all other breaches of this Agreement, you will be provided notice and an opportunity to cure the breach. If the breach is cured in a timely manner and to Drift’s satisfaction, this Agreement will not be permanently terminated. Drift retains the sole and exclusive discretion to determine if a breach of this Agreement has occurred or if the breach has been cured.

<h4>
General
</h4>
<p>
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to choice of law principles. If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non- binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement. In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this Agreement.

.  Any notices to you shall be provided to you through the Drift Platform or given to you via the email address or physical you provide to Drift during the registration process.

The words “include”, “includes” and “including” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”. A party’s failure to act with respect to a breach by the other party does not constitute a waiver of the party’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and Drift with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the parties, whether oral or written.
